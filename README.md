# Use a Pre-Trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
This is the first capstone project I worked on while taking the '[AI Programming with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089)' nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

## Project goal
The project goal was to improve our programming skills in Python utilising a *created* image classifier to identify dog breeds. The focus was on Python and not on the actual classifier.

## Why an image classifier?
Our city is hosting a citywide dog show and we have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information. Some people are planning on registering pets that aren’t actual dogs. We are asked to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

## Our tasks
Using our Python skills, we had to determine:

➡️ which image classification algorithm performed the best on classifying images as **dogs** or **not dogs**.

➡️ how well the best classification algorithm worked on correctly identifying a dog's breed.

➡️ how long each algorithm took to solve the classification problem (*runtime*).
